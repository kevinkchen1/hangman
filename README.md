This program asks the player to choose a word size between 3-12 characters and will be given a random word in the English dictionary. The player has a certain number of lives(1-10) to guess one letter at a time to complete the word, depending on the number of lives chosen.
input: the player will input the size of the word they wish to guess along with the number of lives. They will also be required to input single letters at a time to guess the word.
output: the program will output the letters that have been chosen so far, along with the number of lives remaining, and also the progress of the word the player is guessing with blanks indicating letters that haven't been guessed and the spots with letters indicating correct letters of the word in their proper position.
